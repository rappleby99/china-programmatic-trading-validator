```
✓ SH_PGTDRPT_09999_20251205.xlsx
✓ SZ_PGTDRPT_12345_20251130.xlsx
✗ SH_PGTDRPT_9999_20251205.xlsx     (Missing leading zero)

## About This Project

This tool was created as an AI experiment developed using **Claude Sonnet 4.5** by Anthropic. The objective was to extract Chinese specification documents from Shanghai/Shenzhen Stock Exchanges and CSRC, convert them into unified English validation rules, and implement bilingual validation logic.

**Technology Stack**:
- **Python 3.9+**: Core validation logic
- **openpyxl**: Excel file processing
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Web interface (no external frameworks)
